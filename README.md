### FAQS:

* Q. Â¿Man, you put your themoviedb personal app ke, why?
* A. Dont worry, i change it later (its better for the demo).

* Q. Â¿Why dont use pagination?, themoviedb is using it.
* A. Well, i know, but for this challenge was not mandatory (but yes, in a real case, you must develop pagination 
because themoviedb only work with pages, they dont response a super big json when you exec a ajax request ).

* Q. Â¿Any comment?
* A. I tried to put best practices and use cool stuff like react hooks, in 2-3 days i think its a good and simple challenge :)
   Always you can improve your code of course.
